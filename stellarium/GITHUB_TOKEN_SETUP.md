# GitHub Token Setup for Stellarium

This application now uses OpenAI models through GitHub's AI service. To use this feature, you need to set up a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT).

## Steps to Set Up Your GitHub Token

1. **Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**
   - Go to [GitHub Settings - Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Click on "Generate new token" â†’ "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "Stellarium Horoscope App")
   - Set an expiration date
   - Select the required scopes (typically no special scopes needed for GitHub Models)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **Important**: Copy the token immediately as you won't be able to see it again!

2. **Add the Token to Your Environment**

   For development:
   - Open `src/environments/environment.ts`
   - Replace the empty string with your token:
     ```typescript
     export const environment = {
       production: false,
       githubToken: 'ghp_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
     };
     ```

3. **Security Best Practices**
   - **Never commit your token to version control!**
   - Add `src/environments/environment.ts` to your `.gitignore` file
   - For production, use environment variables or a secure backend service to provide the token

## Alternative: Using Environment Variables

For better security, you can modify the service to read from environment variables:

1. Install `@angular/builders/custom-webpack` and `dotenv-webpack`
2. Create a `.env` file with `GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE`
3. Configure webpack to load environment variables
4. Update the service to read from `process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN`

## Testing the Integration

1. Start the development server: `npm start`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:4200
3. Select a zodiac sign
4. If configured correctly, you should receive a horoscope generated by GPT-4

## Troubleshooting

- If you see "OpenAI client not initialized", check that your token is properly set
- If you get authentication errors, verify your token is valid and not expired
- For rate limiting issues, check GitHub's API rate limits for your account
